# Python Data Science: Day 1

## Overview of Data Science

### What is Data Science?

Mix of:

  - Programming/hacking
  - Math and statistics knowledge
  - Industry expertise

Industry expertise is often overlooked and underrated in its importance.
Need to be able to understand the business to know when to apply data science,
and make convincing arguments about its outcomes/effectiveness.

"Janitor work" (e.g. data cleaning and munging) is the unsexy side but takes a
majority of time. Also allows you to understand data structure and relationships
more.
